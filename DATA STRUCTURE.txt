Tree:
Binary, BST, AVL, B-tree, quad tree, K-d tree, Segment trees, Heap, Minimum spanning tree.
Graph, weighted directional or undirectional.
Pretty simple but it has some good math in it so we need to study some math also taking care of 
graph algorithms and theory.
Algorithm paradigmss: Dynamic programming, Divide and Conquer, and Greedy.
Useful data structures: Disjoint sets.
